## Client
  The client is a small yet plucky emerging creative agency out of Calgary, AB.

  The goal of the site is to help bring attention to this new company as well as add a level of professionalism.


## General Notes
  Overall it works but it's not pretty.
  
  -Toggle is acheived through a hamburger menu.
  -Users will click the burger icon to trigger a navigation menu to pop up.
  -This feature can be turned off and on.
  -Interactivity is achieved through Javascript.
  -The icon switches from a burger to an x to indicate an obvious visual change. 
  
  
  -A button was used for the toggle function.
  -The button is obvious to users and is clickable.
  
  -The Javascript file was linked through an external file in the head of the page and defered to ensure proper functionality.
  -The CSS file was linked externally.
  -Strict mode was used in the Javascript.
  -Project attributes in CSS can be found at the top of the page labeled Hamburger Menu.
